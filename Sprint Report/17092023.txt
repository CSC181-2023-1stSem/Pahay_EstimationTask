Introduction of PHP

Programming languages created PHP is C and Perl.
    Dollar sign to start variable names, associative arrays.

Philosophy of PHP
    Responsible abd intelligent programmer
    U know you want to do
    flexibility in syntax
    convienent possible
    errors fail silently

variable name is start with a dollar sign
    some time the dollar sign might be confusing
    Note:
        Don't ommit Dollar sign when u writing codes

    comments //
    echo - the way we print
    expressing (+,-,*,/)
    more aggressive implicit type of conversion

    Operators of Note
        Increment/Decrement (++, --)
        String concatenation (.) // uses the period character for concatenation 
        Equality (== !=) // more aggressive than most other languages when comes data conversion during expression.
        Identity (=== !==) // ..... 
        Ternary (?:) // allows conditional expression
        Side effect Assignment (+=, _= , .= etc) // These are pure contractions. Use them sparingly
        Ignore the rarely-used bitwise operators (>> << , ^ | &)

    again, php is a type of conversion
        evaluates expressions, at times values in the expression need to be converted
        from one type to another as the computations are done.

        make type conversion (casting) explicit with casting

    casting 
        division forces operands to be floating point.

    Remember:
        Beware FALSE variable. They are detectable but not visible..

    Conditional - if
        Logical Operators (==, !=, < >, <= >= && || !)
        Curly braces
    
    White space does not matter

    While loop
        A while loop is a "zero tip" loop with the test at the top before the first iteration start.
    do while 
        A do while loop is "one-trip" loop worth the test at the bottom after the 
        first iteration completes.
    for loop is the simplest way to construct a counted loop.

    Break out of a loop
        The break statement ends the current loop and jumps to the statement
    Continue
        Continue statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the 
        top of the loop and start the next iteration
